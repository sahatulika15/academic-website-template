### About me

<p style="text-align:justify">I'm a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at
            the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/" target="_blank">Department
              of Computer Science in the University of Liverpool (UoL)</a>,
            United Kingdom. I am a part of the Natural Language Processing group
            at UoL. Prior to joining UoL, I worked with <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/sophia.ananiadou.html"
              target="_blank">Prof.
              Sophia Ananiadou</a>, as a postdoctoral researcher at the National
            Centre for Text Mining (NaCTeM), University of Manchester, UK. I
            earned my Ph.D. in 2021 from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/" target="_blank">Indian
              Institute of Technology Patna, India (IITP)</a>. My Ph.D.
            supervisors were <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/%7Esriparna/" target="_blank">Dr.
              Sriparna Saha</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/%7Epb/"
              target="_blank">
              Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya.</a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My research focuses on developing end to
            end dialogue systems in multi-lingual and multi-modal framework.
            Independent target is set on addressing all the primary modules of
            Dialogue System which includes Natural Language Understanding,
            Dialogue Management Strategy and Natural Language Generation using
            Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Several aspects of human
            behavior such as emotion and sentiment are incorporated to make the
            Virtual Assistant efficient. Investigations have also been extended
            to analyse the content on social media platform such as Twitter.</p>
